# Python Mock ECommerce Platoform

Create a Basic set of APIs that simulates an “**E Commerce Platform**”, For this exercise, the APIs should have the following functionalities 

- **Admin accounts** 
  - Signup/login
  - Manage Categories (add, remove, edit, view)
  - Manage Products (add, remove, edit, view) *Note that all products should have at least one category

- **Users** who can
  - Login and Register
  - View Products and Categories

## Authentication and Session Management

1. Authentication and Authorization should be done using `JWT`.

## Tools/Stack

- Python/Flask
- Postgress SQL

## Submission

1. Your API endpoints should be documented in POSTMAN or SWAGGER UI.
2. Seed the Database with lots of data before final submission.
3. Code should be hosted on a git repository, Github preferably.
4. The API should be hosted on a live server (e.g. https://heroku.com)

**What we'll be looking out for:**

- Component architecture
- Clean code
- Data modelling
- Proper use of data structures
- Validation

_As a bonus:_

You'll get bonus points for:
1. Use of GraphQL
2. Pagination
3. Proper sorting and filtering
4. Simulating purchase
